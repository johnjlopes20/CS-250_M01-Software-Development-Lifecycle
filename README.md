**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?
**

When interpreting user needs, I start by engaging directly with stakeholders or the project requirements to understand the problems or goals they are trying to address. I then translate those needs into specific features or functionalities. Creating user stories helps me break down complex requirements into manageable tasks. By framing features from the perspective of the user, I can prioritize what is most important to them and ensure I’m building the right solutions. For example, a user story might be "As a user, I want to be able to log in with my Google account so that I can access my profile easily." This keeps the focus on the user’s experience and makes it easier to plan and deliver incremental improvements.

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
**

My approach to developing programs is iterative and incremental. I begin by breaking down the problem into smaller, solvable parts and aim to deliver working code in short cycles. I focus on Agile principles, such as delivering functional features early and often, gathering feedback, and making continuous improvements. Moving forward, I hope to incorporate more Scrum processes like sprints, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives. These processes will help me stay on track, improve collaboration, and ensure that each iteration is focused on delivering value to the user. Using user stories to define and prioritize tasks will also continue to guide my development approach.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
**

Being a good team member means actively contributing to the success of the project while fostering a collaborative and supportive environment. It’s about being communicative, transparent, and receptive to feedback. In software development, a good team member is someone who listens to others’ ideas, shares their own insights, and works together to solve problems. I believe that being dependable and maintaining a positive attitude, even when facing challenges, helps keep the team motivated and focused. Additionally, I think a good team member is one who helps the team continuously improve by participating in retrospectives and learning from both successes and mistakes.
